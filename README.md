# Contrast dynamics of the Scintillating and Hermann Grid illusions

This repository contains the supplementary code notebooks used to analyze and create figures for the research project: "Contrast dynamics of the Scintillating and Hermann Grid illusions". It includes "mainFigures.ipynb" which is a notebook that includes the main figure plots from the experimental data and also fitted trajectories from the dynamical models. "periodAnalysis.ipynb" contains code for finding the mean period and visualizing the distributions of periods of illusion reappearance from experimental data. Experimental data can be made available upon request to interested collaborators.
