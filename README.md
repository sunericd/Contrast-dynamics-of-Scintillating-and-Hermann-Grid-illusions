# Characterizing the whiteness dependence of the Hermann and Scintillating Grid visual illusions

This code repository contains the supplementary Jupyter (Python 3) notebooks that were used to analyze and create figures for the research project: "Characterizing the whiteness dependence of the Hermann and Scintillating Grid visual illusions". It includes:

- "mainFigures.ipynb" -- notebook with the main figure plots from the experimental data and also functions for automatically fitting polynomial models. There are also functions for manually fitting dynamical Hopf bifurcations to the data.
- "periodAnalysis.ipynb" -- notebook for finding the mean period and visualizing the distributions of periods of illusion reappearance from experimental data. Experimental data can be made available upon request to interested collaborators.
- "field_plots.nb" -- Mathematica notebook with phase diagrams and field plots of the dynamical models

In addition to the code notebooks, the entire stimuli set used for the visual experiments are included.
